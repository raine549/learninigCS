///What is OOP?
/// Object-Oritented Programming
/// 
/// Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data
/// OOP is about creating objects that contain both data and methods
/// Advantages of OOP include: 
///   faster and easier to execute
///   OOP provides clear structure for programs
///   easier to maintain, modify and debug
///   makes it possible to create applications with less code & shorter development time
///   
/// DRY ("dont repeat yourself") principle is about reducing repetition of code
///
/// class: car , objects: volvo, audi, toyota
/// class: fruit , objects: banana, apple, orange
/// a class is a template for objects
/// an object is an instance of a class
/// 
/// when individual objects are created, they inherit all variables and methods from class
/// 
///C# is an object-oriented programming language!
///
/// an object (car) has attributes (weight, colour) and methods (drive, brake)
/// a class is a "blueprint" for creating objects
